## Low-Fidelity Prototype - Michelle Xu 

## Description 
### Purpose:
The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to see whether or not the features that I have created are helpful and  easily usable by the target user demographic.

### User Personas:
The user personas that I have included is characterized by the following have identified can be characterized by the following: people who enjoy sharing music, people who enjoy talking about music, and people who are avid music concerts, and festivals goers. 

### Tasks
Discover people to talk about music with. 

Find the music that other people post

View daily updates and notifications.

## Wireframes & Wireflows
Wireframes from this prototype are available: here.

All wireframes and wireflows can be found here.

## Summary
Creating the low-fidelity prototype helped me clearly see the vision I had for the app I am passionate about. It helped me see things that would be a struggle for users, such as the distance between buttons, and whether the process of doing a task flows smoothly. 

Through this process, I erased a lot of what I originally thought would work out. It made me excited to see what it would look like if I digitized it into a high-fidelity prototype. Originally,I thought I wouldn't have enough details to help users navigate efficiently but realized I overthought it. 

Drawing the wireframes/flows, I felt myself trying to emphathize with a user more, which is where personas come in and helped me see what I would really want to see from an app. This also made me realize how important it is for back and forward buttons, cancel buttons, etc. 

Overall, it was an important sketch for me to see what to add or take away. I think low-fidelity prototyping is very important for us to help users have a more effiecient and satisfactory experience and highlighted parts that I would have missed if I just went straight to digitizing the prototype.
