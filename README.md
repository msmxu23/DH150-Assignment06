## Low-Fidelity Prototype - Michelle Xu 

## Overview
**Description:** My project is a music events app that allows users to make new friends, talk about the latest in the music industry, and be up to date with current and future events. Three features that I created emphasizes the overall social aspect and sense of community of the app. Music shouldn't just be listened to; music should be a way for people to connect with others and express themselves, it should be enjoyed and appreciated live, and shared with the rest of the community of music lovers. This app won't only help support artists but allow users to create a bigger or more genuine network, and for them to feel more comfortable getting out there and enjoying music life. If users feel that they are able to share their music and theirselves creatively, feel accepted and included, then they will come back and use the app more often to be more involved with the community around them.  

Through the low-fidelity prototype process, I can see whether the features I designed would benefit certain user personas. I will be able to see what flows well and what doesn't. The wireflows will show me how users would navigate the features and whether it is efficient for them to do certain tasks. If something looks difficult or out of the way, I can come up with better solutions, iterate the design process, and map a more efficient way to navigate through the app. 

**Purpose:** The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to see whether or not the features that I have created are helpful and  easily usable by the target user demographic.

**User Personas**
The user personas that I have included is characterized by the following have identified can be characterized by the following: people who enjoy sharing music, people who enjoy talking about music, and people who are avid music concerts, and festivals goers. 

**Tasks/Features**
1. Forum/Chat box: allows you to create topics, comment on each other's posts, like comments, repost, or share opinions related to music
2. Connect: suggests other users as potential friends, will show you mutual friends, mutual taste in music, etc
3. The Latest: notifies you on the latest events from artists you like, whether it is their tours, shows, meet & greet, released albums, or songs

## Wireframes & Wireflows

## Reflection/Summary
Creating the low-fidelity prototype helped me clearly see the vision I had for the app I am passionate about. It helped me see things that would be a struggle for users, such as the distance between buttons, and whether the process of doing a task flows smoothly. 

Through this process, I erased a lot of what I originally thought would work out. It made me excited to see what it would look like if I digitized it into a high-fidelity prototype. Originally,I thought I wouldn't have enough details to help users navigate efficiently but realized I overthought it. 

Drawing the wireframes/flows, I felt myself trying to emphathize with a user more, which is where personas come in and helped me see what I would really want to see from an app. This also made me realize how important it is for back and forward buttons, cancel buttons, etc. 

Overall, it was an important sketch for me to see what to add or take away. I think low-fidelity prototyping is very important for us to help users have a more effiecient and satisfactory experience and highlighted parts that I would have missed if I just went straight to digitizing the prototype.
