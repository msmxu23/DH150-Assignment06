## Low-Fidelity Prototype - Michelle Xu 

## Description 
My project is based on a new music app, called Audius. I want to add features that emphasize the overall social aspect and sense of community of the app. Music shouldn't just be a place to listen to music but a way to connect with others and express ourselves. Using Audius won't only support artists but help listeners and users feel more motivated to use the app. If users feel as if they are able to share their music and their selves creatively, and feel accepted and included, then they will come back and use the app more often to be more involved. 

Through this low-fidelity prototype process, I was able to see whether the features I designed would benefit these personas.I can see what flows well and what doesn't. The wireflows will show me how users would navigate the features. If I come across problems, I can come up with better solutions and map a more efficient way.

## Purpose:
The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to see whether or not the features that I have created are helpful and  easily usable by the target user demographic.

## User Personas:
The user personas that I have included is characterized by the following have identified can be characterized by the following: people who enjoy sharing music, people who enjoy talking about music, and people who are avid music concerts, and festivals goers. 

## Tasks/Features
Forum/Chat box: allows you to create topics, comment on each other's posts, like comments, repost, or share opinions related to music
Connect: suggests other users as potential friends, will show you mutual friends, mutual taste in music, etc
The Latest: notifies you on the latest events from artists you like, whether it is their tours, shows, meet & greet, released albums, or songs

## Wireframes & Wireflows
Wireframes from this prototype are available: here.

All wireframes and wireflows can be found here.

## Summary
Creating the low-fidelity prototype helped me clearly see the vision I had for the app I am passionate about. It helped me see things that would be a struggle for users, such as the distance between buttons, and whether the process of doing a task flows smoothly. 

Through this process, I erased a lot of what I originally thought would work out. It made me excited to see what it would look like if I digitized it into a high-fidelity prototype. Originally,I thought I wouldn't have enough details to help users navigate efficiently but realized I overthought it. 

Drawing the wireframes/flows, I felt myself trying to emphathize with a user more, which is where personas come in and helped me see what I would really want to see from an app. This also made me realize how important it is for back and forward buttons, cancel buttons, etc. 

Overall, it was an important sketch for me to see what to add or take away. I think low-fidelity prototyping is very important for us to help users have a more effiecient and satisfactory experience and highlighted parts that I would have missed if I just went straight to digitizing the prototype.
